                <p class="P">C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.It is a very popular language, despite being old. The main reason for its popularity is because it is a fundamental language in the field of computer science.C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.It is one of the most popular programming language in the world.If you know C, you will have no problem learning other popular programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, C#, etc, as the syntax is similar.C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java and Python.C is very versatile; it can be used in both applications and technologies.
                    To start using C, you need two things:A text editor, like Notepad, to write C code.A compiler, like GCC, to translate the C code into a language that the computer will understand.There are many text editors and compilers to choose from.An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is used to edit AND compile the code.Popular IDE's include Code::Blocks, Eclipse, and Visual Studio. These are all free, and they can be used to both edit and debug C code.Note: Web-based IDE's can work as well, but functionality is limited.
                    We will use Code::Blocks in our tutorial, which we believe is a good place to start.You can find the latest version of Codeblocks at http://www.codeblocks.org/. Download the mingw-setup.exe file, which will install the text editor with a compiler.C Quickstart Let's create our first C file.Open Codeblocks and go to File > New > Empty File. Write the following C code and save the file as my first program.c (File > Save File as):

            <div class="D" id="Python">
                <h1 class="H">Python</h1>
                <p class="P">Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.It is used for: web development (server-side),software development, mathematics,system scripting.Python can be used on a server to create web applications.Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.
                    In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
                    Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.</p>

            <div class="D" id="C++">
                <h1 class="H">C++</h1>
                <p class="P"> C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.The language was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20.C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.
                    C++ is fun and easy to learn!.As C++ is close to C, C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages have almost the same syntax.The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ support classes and objects, while C does not.</p>

            <div class="D" id="Java">
                <h1 class="H">Java</h1>
                <p class="P"> Java is a popular programming language, created in 1995.It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java.It is used for:Mobile applications (specially Android apps) Desktop applications Web applications,Web servers and application servers Games Database connection And much, much more! Why Use Java?ava works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)It is one of the most popular programming language in the world.It has a large demand in the current job market.It is easy to learn and simple to use.It is open-source and free.It is secure, fast and powerful.It has a huge community support (tens of millions of developers)
                    Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa.Get StartedSome PCs might have Java already installed.</p>

            <div class="D" id="SQL">
                <h1 class="H">SQL</h1>
                <p class="P">SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.SQL stands for Structured Query Language.SQL lets you access and manipulate databases.SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987SQL can execute queries against a database.SQL can retrieve data from a database.SQL can insert records in a database.SQL can update records in a database.SQL can delete records from a database.SQL can create new databases.SQL can create new tables in a database.SQL can create stored procedures in a database.SQL can create views in a database.SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views
                    SQL is a Standard - BUT....To build a web site that shows data from a database, you will need Although SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard, there are different versions of the SQL language.However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE) in a similar manner.An RDBMS database program (i.e. MS Access, SQL Server, MySQL)To use a server-side scripting language, like PHP or ASP.To use SQL to get the data you want.To use HTML / CSS to style the page

            <div class="D" id="Html">
                <h1 class="H">Html</h1>
                <p class="P">HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.HTML describes the structure of a Web page.HTML consists of a series of elements.HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.The declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 documentThe html element is the root element of an HTML page The head element contains meta information about the HTML pageThe title element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
                    The body element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.The h1 element defines a large heading.The p element defines a paragraph.What is an HTML Element?An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:<tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>.The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:Start tag	Elem.The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them correctly.A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document:</p>

            <div class="D" id="Css">
                <h1 class="H">CSS</h1>
                <p class="P">CSS is the language we use to style a Web page.CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.External stylesheets are stored in CSS filesHTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page. HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:When tags like font and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.
                    To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!.he selector points to the HTML element you want to style.The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.
